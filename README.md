# SQL Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Layoffs 2022 Dataset

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on **cleaning and analyzing the 2022 Layoffs dataset** from Kaggle using SQL.  
The dataset contains global layoff records from companies across multiple industries.  
The project is divided into two phases:
1. **Data Cleaning** ‚Äì Making the dataset accurate, consistent, and analysis-ready.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** ‚Äì Uncovering trends and insights from the cleaned data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Phase 1: Data Cleaning
##  Steps in Data Cleaning
1. **Remove Duplicates**  
   - Used `ROW_NUMBER()` to detect and delete duplicates.  

2. **Standardize Data**  
   - Trimmed whitespace in company names.  
   - Standardized `industry` (e.g., all variations of "Crypto" ‚Üí "Crypto").  
   - Fixed inconsistent country names (e.g., "United States." ‚Üí "United States").  
   - Converted `date` column from text to proper `DATE` format.  

3. **Handle Null / Missing Values**  
   - Replaced blank industries with `NULL`.  
   - Used self-joins to fill in missing industry values based on the same company.  
   - Removed rows where both `total_laid_off` and `percentage_laid_off` were missing.  

4. **Final Cleaning**  
   - Dropped helper column `row_num`.  
   - Stored the clean data in a staging table `layoffs_staging2`.

## üìà Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
##  Steps in EDA
1. **Date Range of Dataset**
SELECT MIN(`date`), MAX(`date`)
FROM layoffs_staging2;

**‚úÖ Shows earliest and latest layoffs in the dataset.**

3. **Companies with 100% Layoffs**
SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE percentage_laid_off = 1
ORDER BY funds_raised_millions DESC;

**‚úÖ Identifies companies that shut down completely.**

5. **Top Companies by Total Layoffs**
SELECT company, SUM(total_laid_off) AS total_layoffs
FROM layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY company
ORDER BY total_layoffs DESC;

**‚úÖ Meta, Amazon, and Google reported the highest layoffs.**

4.**Layoffs by Industry**
SELECT industry, SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY industry
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

**‚úÖ Tech-related industries, especially Consumer and Crypto, were hit hardest.**

5. **Layoffs by Country**
SELECT country, SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

**‚úÖ The United States had the majority of layoffs.**

7. **Layoffs Over Time (Monthly + Rolling Total)**
WITH Rolling_Total AS 
(
  SELECT SUBSTRING(`date`, 1, 7) AS `month`, SUM(total_laid_off) AS total_off
  FROM layoffs_staging2
  GROUP BY `month`
)
SELECT `month`, total_off,
       SUM(total_off) OVER(ORDER BY `month`) AS Rolling_Total
FROM Rolling_Total;

**‚úÖ Shows cumulative layoffs month by month.**

9. **Top 5 Companies per Year (Ranked)**
WITH Company_Year (company, years, total_laid_off) AS
(
  SELECT company, YEAR(`date`), SUM(total_laid_off)
  FROM layoffs_staging2
  GROUP BY company, YEAR(`date`)
), Company_Year_Rank AS
(
  SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY years ORDER BY total_laid_off DESC) AS Ranking
  FROM Company_Year
  WHERE years IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT *
FROM Company_Year_Rank
WHERE Ranking <= 5;

**‚úÖ Lists the top 5 companies with the most layoffs each year.**

**üîë Key Insights**

üìÖ Layoffs spanned from 2020 to 2023.

üè¢ Meta, Amazon, and Google were among the companies with the largest layoffs.

üåç The United States accounted for most layoffs.

üíª The Tech industry faced the biggest cuts.

üìà Layoffs increased significantly in late 2022.
